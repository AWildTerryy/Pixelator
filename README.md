# Pixelator
Turn an image into a pixelated image using AWS

The purpose of this was to follow a tutorial and familiarize myself with Amazon Web Services(AWS). The tutorial can be found here:

Note that there are two deployment zips; the original one and an edited one to create only 3 images instead of 5. The sample folder includes original images and the result stored in the processed S3 bucket.
