# Pixelator
Turn an image into a pixelated image using AWS

The purpose of this was to follow a tutorial and familiarize myself with Amazon Web Services(AWS). The tutorial can be found here:

https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs/tree/master/00-aws-simple-demos/aws-lambda-s3-events

Note that there are two deployment zips; the original one and an edited one to create only 3 images instead of 5. The sample folder includes original images and the result stored in the processed S3 bucket.
